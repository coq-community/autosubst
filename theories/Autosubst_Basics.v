  General automation tactics.
  - "autorew": Tries to rewrite with any equation in the context.
  - "autorevert h": Reverts the assumption h along with all of its
    dependencies.
  - "inv h": Does an inversion on h and cleans up the goal.
  - "ainv": Inverts any assumptions where inv produces only a single
    non-trivial subgoal. Takes a tactic as an optional arguments which is
    used to solve trivial subgoals. Defaults to "ainv trivial".
    Subgoals
  - "ren H: T": Search the context for an assumption which matches the
    pattern T and renames it to H.
  - "renc H: T": Same as above, but tries to match a subterm against T.
